                          Not only was he super friendly &amp; beyond
                          accommodating, he was excited to just be a part of our
                          day, and those things made all the difference! As a
                          bride, you undoubtedly worry about many things the
                          weekend of your wedding. I can whole-heartedly say,
                          Brian was NEVER one of them! Not only did he give a
                          flawless performance as I walked down the aisle
                          <span class="visible-desktop"
                            >, he also gave an emotional performance. Without
                            exaggeration, every one of my wedding guests were
                            absolutely BLOWN AWAY by Brian!!!  In addition to
                            the love shared that day that was tangible to all
                            who attended, you add in Brian Wiltsey, and magic
                            truly happened. To this day, 3 months later...I'm
                            STILL getting compliments on Brian &amp; how
                            wonderful he was!
                            <!-- There really aren't enough words to capture how thankful I am for what has turned into an awesome friendship between us, but also my gratitude for his role in our day. -->
                            Our wedding honestly would not have been what it was
                            without Brian's presence, and for that I am
                            eternally grateful! We would recommend him over
                            &amp; over &amp; over!!!</span

                          The After Party MADE our wedding! Brian was very easy
                          and fun to work with and everyone in the band was so
                          friendly and talented. This band is not your typical
                          wedding band which is exactly what we wanted! We
                          wanted everyone to feel like they were at a concert
                          and they absolutely did. I recommend these guys to
                          anyone looking for something different and completely
                          awesome. They kept our dance floor full and had the
                          crowd begging for encores!

                          night did end.  Since the wedding, we have received
                          countless comments on how awesome our band was.  It
                          truly was amazing how everyone was on the dance floor
                          dancing. I can sincerely say that from start to
                          finish, The After Party made our wedding a fun night
                          for everyone.

                          My wife Michelle and I were lucky to find Brian and
                          The Afterparty for our wedding this past July. Being
                          in our mid-20s, we have been going to a lot of
                          weddings and have had an opportunity to see a lot of
                          wedding bands and the one thing we knew when we
                          started looking for a band is that we did not want the
                          typical "YMCA" type of wedding band.

                            and set list. The music and song selection was
                            phenomenal but what really put these guys over the
                            top was how personable they were on and off stage.
                            They sat down with us weeks before the wedding to
                            get to know us and the type of music we wanted. I
                            recommend these guys to everyone and anyone.</span

                          The After Party was a hit at our wedding! We had
                          numerous attendees comment on how great the band was
                          both during the reception and in the weeks following.
                          The song selection was perfect, as they were able to
                          gauge the crowd and build the energy through the
                          night. We even found Carly&#8217;s 80 year old
                          grandfather out on the dance floor. I would suggest
                          The After Party to anyone that wants a wonderful
                          wedding experience

                                        The After Party was exactly what we were looking for.  They played a wide range of songs that everybody could dance to and many that the whole dance floor was singing along with.  They are not your typical wedding band.  There is nothing cheesy about them, just pure musical talent.  If you are looking for a rock band to play your wedding or event you will not be disappointed with the After Party.  They were the part of our wedding that we easily received the most complements on from our guests!</div>
